## 📌 Question
Design a 1-12 counter with the following inputs and outputs:

Reset Synchronous active-high reset that forces the counter to 1
Enable Set high for the counter to run
Clk Positive edge-triggered clock input
```Q[3:0]``` The output of the counter
```c_enable, c_load, c_d[3:0]``` Control signals going to the provided 4-bit counter, so correct operation can be verified.
You have the following components available:

the 4-bit binary counter (count4) below, which has Enable and synchronous parallel-load inputs (load has higher priority than enable). The count4 module is provided to you. Instantiate it in your circuit.
logic gates
```verilog
module count4(
	input clk,
	input enable,
	input load,
	input [3:0] d,
	output reg [3:0] Q
);
```
The c_enable, c_load, and c_d outputs are the signals that go to the internal counter's enable, load, and d inputs, respectively. Their purpose is to allow these signals to be checked for correctness.

## 🧑‍💻 Code Example

```verilog
module top_module (
    input clk,
    input reset,
    input enable,
    output [3:0] Q,
    output c_enable,
    output c_load,
    output [3:0] c_d
); 
    assign c_load = (reset | (Q==4'hC & enable));
    assign c_d = (c_load)? 4'b0001: ~(4'b0001);
    assign c_enable = (enable & ~c_load);

    count4 the_counter (.clk(clk), .enable(c_enable), 
                        .load(c_load), .d(c_d), .Q(Q) );

endmodule
```
> ```assign c_d = (c_load)? 4'b0001: ~(4'b0001);``` is for skipping stuck-at GND/VCC warning.
